### Reflection

I had an amazing time in **21-241**. Dr. Simone is a fantastic teacher and explains things very well. This class also had a final project component where we made something using ideas we learned in class. I made a project about visualizing 4D shapes in 2D (on screens) - it was fun!.  
**15-151** was my favorite class this semester. Dr. Mackey is a beyond amazing teacher and he really cares about each student. This class revolved around proofs which was a bit new to me but I absolutely enjoyed it immensely.  
I found the programming HWs in **15-122** fun and useful even if they seemed long. The weekly checkin/quiz system was also very useful and I found myself less stressed over the semester and didn't need to study as much for the final. The class taught me principles that are really important, but nothing was really conceptually hard. That said, the class is still pretty hard since there's a lot to do.  
**76-101** wasn't a class that took a lot of my time. The professor was nice and very engaging but I don't feel that I walked away from the class having learned anything, just more practice with writing.
**07-131** had some content that I found very useful, but a lot of it was something I already knew. I would say that since this class takes very little commitment, if there's a topic that you don't know or want a refresher on, it doesn't hurt to throw this into your schedule.  
**07-128** is the SCS freshman immigration course. There is not much to say here.
